# Summary

The 20 amino acids commonly found as residues in proteins contain an $\alpha-$carboxyl group, an $\alpha-$amino group, and a distinctive R group **substituted on the $\alpha$-carbon atom**.  ^f1b1c5

The $\alpha-$carbon atom of all amino acids except glycine is **asymmetric**, and thus amino acids can exist in at least **two** stereoisomeric forms. Only the **L stereoisomers**, with a configuration related to the absolute configuration of the reference molecule **L-glyceraldehyde**, are found in proteins. ^c47fc6

Other, less common amino acids also occur, either as constituents of proteins (through modification of common amino acid residues after protein synthesis) or as free metabolites.

Amino acids are classified into **five types** on the basis of the **polarity** and **charge** (at pH 7) of their R groups.

Amino acids vary in their acid-base properties and have characteristic **titration curves**. Monoamino monocarboxylic amino acids (with nonionizable R groups) are diprotic acids ($\ce{^+H_{3}NCH(R)COOH}$) at low pH and exist in several different ionic forms as the pH is increased. Amino acids with ionizable R groups have additional ionic species, depending on the pH of the medium and the pKa of the R group.
