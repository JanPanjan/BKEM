Most cells are microscopic, invisible to the unaided eye. Animal and plant cells are typically $5$ to $100 \ m$ in diameter, and many bacteria are only $1$ to $2 \ m$ long. 

# What limits the dimensions of a cell? 

The lower limit is probably set by the minimum number of each type of biomolecule required by the cell. The smallest cells, certain bacteria known as mycoplasmas, are $300 \ nm$ in diameter and have a volume of about $10^{-14} \ mL$. A single bacterial ribosome is about $20 \ nm$ in its longest dimension, so a few ribosomes take up a sub- stantial fraction of the volume in a mycoplasmal cell. The upper limit of cell size is probably set by the rate of diffusion of solute molecules in aqueous systems. For example, a bacterial cell that depends upon oxygen- consuming reactions for energy production must obtain molecular oxygen by diffusion from the surrounding medium through its plasma membrane. The cell is so small, and the ratio of its surface area to its volume is so large, that every part of its cytoplasm is easily reached by $O_{2}$ diffusing into the cell. As cell size increases, how- ever, surface-to-volume ratio decreases, until metabo- lism consumes $O_{2}$ faster than diffusion can supply it. Metabolism that requires $O_{2}$ thus becomes impossible as cell size increases beyond a certain point, placing a theoretical upper limit on the size of the cell.
