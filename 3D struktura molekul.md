Ko govorimo o 3D strukturi molekul v prostoru, govorimo o [[Izomerija|izomeriji]]. Beri [Constitutional Isomer - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/constitutional-isomer).

Interakcije med molekulami so **stereo-specifične** (odvisne od določene konfiguracije ali konformacije molekule). 

Encim in substrat, receptor in hormon, antigen in protitelo...

[[Stereospecifičnost]] je v bistvu lastnost encimov in nekaterih proteinov

# Summary
- Because of its bonding versatility, carbon can produce a broad array of carbon–carbon skeletons with a variety of functional groups; these groups give biomolecules their biological and chemical personalities.
- A nearly universal set of several hundred small molecules is found in living cells; the interconver- sions of these molecules in the central metabolic pathways have been conserved in evolution.
- Proteins and nucleic acids are linear polymers of simple monomeric subunits; their sequences contain the information that gives each molecule its three-dimensional structure and its biological functions.
- Molecular configuration can be changed only by breaking covalent bonds. For a carbon atom with four different substituents (a chiral carbon), the substituent groups can be arranged in two different ways, generating stereoisomers with distinct properties. Only one stereoisomer is biologically active. Molecular conformation is the position of atoms in space that can be changed by rotation about single bonds, without breaking covalent bonds.
- Interactions between biological molecules are almost invariably stereospecific: they require a complementary match between the interacting molecules.
